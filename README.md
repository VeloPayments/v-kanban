Project Kanban for Blockchain Demo
==================================

This kanban is maintained as a simple HTML file with some CSS markup.

To run the board, you'll need Python 3.  Run the following command:

```bash
    python3 -m http.server
```

To update the board, look in kanban.js and follow the example provided.  Always
append actions to the end of the `updateBoard` function so we can keep track of
changes with the changelog.
